# [](#header-2)About Me
Hey Guys Today I write about how to pwn htb machines and how you can pwn all machines

First let me tell you about myself 

I was  learning cyber security for couples of months.I prepared for my local ctf competation.The categories are web,crypto,forensics,pwn and reverse engineering.

My role is web,crypto and forenscis.I learned crypto before this competation.Web is familair with me but my teamate is really good at web so I decide to focus crypto and forenscis.

So I did more challenges about crypto and forenniscs.

I think I just prepare for one month to done all this stuff.But our team reanked 3 in our local ctf open level competation.

# [](#header-2)How did I learn

After that my teamates suggest me to try HTB machines.Before I go htb I already learn something about web application  pentesting like sqli,xss,etc...

also watch ippsec youtube channel and read some retired machine writes up.At first,I decide to solve vulnhub machines.But there  is a problem that I have a touble with settting up machines

So I decide to read writes up.I started my frist box as netwroked,it is really easy but I just pwned user.For the root part I dont know where to go.

Then I ask my fri.He helped me to get root.After solving 2 boxes with some helps I familiar with this.I know what to do.

So here is my tips 

1.Enumeration
2.Think what you got 
3.Read documentaion about this 
4.search for exploit(Note that sometimes it doesnt have exploit then u need to exploit read docs by yourself)
5.Exploit it 

That's my tips.

I just wanna suggesst you 

check retired machines writes up in ippsec

also check other people's writes up so that you'll get a new way.If you dont know how to do it just  ask for help and check htb forum cause you are not god,you cannot know everything lol.

If you wanna be guru on hack the box,you need to learn all the categories in ctf.PWN,RE,WEB,CRYPTO AND FORENSIC.

So go to ctftime.org and learn this stuff.I'm also learning hope that it helps.

If you wanna know some more you can ask me.There are resources setcion in my blog check that.


Some people said I'm so fast.Yes I just slept for hours per day when I was solving htb for a month.That's took me to get prohakcer then got guru.

When I was solving sniper machine,I was sick for ten days.So Sleep well then try harder.Take care of your help.If you dont have a good health,you can't do anything 
Hope this help

Enjoy:-)
